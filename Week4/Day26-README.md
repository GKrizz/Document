# 🗓️ Day 25 – June 12, 2025 (Thursday)

## 📂 Main Controller: `MUPerformanceRateController`

### 🎯 Purpose

The `MUPerformanceRateController` is responsible for managing endpoints related to MIPS (Merit-based Incentive Payment System) performance and reporting. It provides three key functionalities:

1. **Get Patients Seen**
   **Method:** `getPatientsSeen`
   Retrieves the list of patients seen by a provider within a given time frame.

2. **Generate and Validate QDM**
   **Method:** `generateAndValidateQDM`
   Generates and validates the **Quality Data Model (QDM)** for clinical quality measure reporting. Ensures compliance with required standards.

3. **Calculate MIPS Performance**
   **Method:** `calculateMIPSPerformance`
   Calculates provider performance metrics according to MIPS guidelines. Used for quality scoring and CMS submissions.

## 🔍 Task: Analyze the Flow

The objective for today was to **analyze the internal flow** of the following methods in the `MUPerformanceRateController`:

* `getPatientsSeen`
* `generateAndValidateQDM`
* `calculateMIPSPerformance`

This includes understanding:

* Input parameters and validation
* Service layer interactions
* Data transformation processes
* Output structure and responses
* Error handling patterns
