## ‚úÖ Interoperability Error Documentation

**Channel**: `GlenwoodSystems_CT_IB_CCDA_ADT`
**System**: MirthConnect (AMC-CCDA-CONNIE)
**Date Resolved**: July 15, 2025
**Reported By**: CRISP Interface Support

---

### üìå Issue Summary

At least **15 errors** were identified on the channel `GlenwoodSystems_CT_IB_CCDA_ADT`, which processes CCDA documents and creates ADT messages.

#### Breakdown of Errors:

* **3 errors** due to **unmapped OID**: `2.16.840.1.113883.3.225.10.10451` (CONTEMPORARY CARE account)
* **12 errors** caused by **invalid/special characters** in CCDA documents:

  * 8 errors for one patient
  * 2 errors for a second patient
  * 2 errors for a third patient

---

### üîç Root Cause

1. **Unmapped OID**: The OID was not mapped at the time of message transmission, resulting in failure before interface processing.
2. **Special Characters in CDA**: CCDA payloads included unsupported or malformed characters that caused parsing failures on the receiving interface.

## üõ† Resolution Steps

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Retrieve CDA Files via SFTP

The problematic CDA files were accessed and downloaded locally for inspection.

#### **Connection Info**

* **Remote Directory:** `/Temp/Gobal`
* **Local Directory:** `/home/software/Documents/maureen_CDA_files`
* **SFTP Tool:** labs3 connection

#### **SFTP Session Log**

```bash
# Change to remote directory
sftp> cd /Temp/Gobal

# List remote files
sftp> ls -lth

# Check current remote directory
sftp> pwd
Remote working directory: /Temp/Gobal

# Check current local shell directory
sftp> !pwd
/home/software/Downloads/tomcat9/bin

# Change local directory
sftp> lcd '/home/software/Documents/maureen_CDA_files'

# Confirm local directory
sftp> !pwd
/home/software/Documents/maureen_CDA_files
```

#### **File Transfers**

```bash
# Download 1st CDA file
sftp> get OUT-07-22-2025-04-55-46-293-432.cda
# Download successful

# List files again
sftp> ls -lrth

# Download 2nd CDA file
sftp> get OUT-07-22-2025-06-10-21-699-432.cda
# Download successful
```

#### **Session Ended Unexpectedly**

```bash
client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe
Connection closed.
```

*‚ö†Ô∏è Both files were successfully downloaded before disconnection. No retransmission required.*

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Analyze Medication Section via API Trace

To identify why **invalid characters** were present in the CDA, I reviewed the backend code responsible for generating the **Medication Section** of the CCDA.

---

### üîç Code Path Investigated

**Primary File:**
`MedicationSectionHandler.java`
**Method:**

```java
public POCDMT000040Component3 getSectionComponent(HandlerConfig config)
```

#### ‚úÖ Core Logic Summary:

* Retrieves **active medications** using `MedicationDAO.getActiveMedications(...)`
* Depending on `EncounterId` or `FromDate/ToDate`, it builds the medication list.
* Forms CDA `Section` using:

  * `Narrative Block`: `MedicationUtil.getNarrativeBlock(...)`
  * `Coded Block`: `MedicationUtil.getCodedBlock(...)`

#### üìç Null Flavour Fallback

If no medications are found:

```java
return getNullFlavourSection(config);
```

---

### üîç Data Source Traced

**DAO Layer:**
`MedicationDAO.java ‚Üí getActiveMedications(...)`

* Internally calls:
  `PrescriptionModel.activePrescAndNursePrescActiveQry(...)`

* Output: `JSONArray` of prescriptions from **two sources**:

  * `current_medication` (nurse)
  * `doc_presc` (doctor)

---

### üîç SQL Debugging (System.out Log)

You printed out the full dynamic SQL using `System.out.println(qry.toString());` to capture the live query being executed, including:

* All active/inactive medication fields
* RXNorm codes
* Date filters based on request
* Source differentiation (`nurse` vs `doctor`)
* LOINC template and section titles for CCDA

---

### üß† Observation

* Special characters likely came from fields like:

  * `doc_presc_comments`
  * `current_medication_notes`
  * `drugname`, `dosagename`, or `addi`
* These fields are later used to construct the **narrative block**, which maps to the `<text>` section of the CDA.

---

### üîÑ **Main Changes in Logic**

| Section                        | Previous Query | This Query   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| `current_medication_is_active` | `true`         | `false`      |
| `doc_presc_is_active`          | `true`         | `false`      |
| `med_status_group`             | `'active'`     | `'inactive'` |

This ensures you're fetching **only deactivated / stopped / expired prescriptions** from both sources:

* **Nurse-entered medications**: from `current_medication`
* **Doctor prescriptions**: from `doc_presc`

---

### Issue Summary:

The `doc_presc_intake` field contained invalid, non-printable ASCII character `CHR(2)` (`\x02`), caused by entering `1\2` instead of `1/2`. This corrupted data led to CCDA interface validation errors.

---

### Verification Queries and Results:

#### 1. Check for fraction-like strings in `current_medication_intake`:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT current_medication_intake 
FROM current_medication 
WHERE current_medication_intake ~ '\d+/\d+';
```

*Returns all distinct intakes with fraction formats like `1/2`.*

---

#### 2. Find corrupted records in `doc_presc` for specific patients (with `\x02` present):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT doc_presc_intake, doc_presc_patient_id, doc_presc_id
FROM doc_presc
WHERE doc_presc_intake LIKE '%' || CHR(2) || '%'
  AND doc_presc_patient_id IN ('018838', '9340', '018060');
```

| doc\_presc\_intake | doc\_presc\_patient\_id | doc\_presc\_id |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| 1\x02tab           | 18060                   | 47177          |
| 1\x02Tab           | 9340                    | 58005          |
| 1\x02tsp           | 18838                   | 47012          |

---

#### 3. Find all records with invalid `\x02` in `doc_presc_intake`:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT doc_presc_intake, doc_presc_patient_id, doc_presc_id
FROM doc_presc
WHERE doc_presc_intake LIKE '%' || CHR(2) || '%';
```

*Result matches above 3 rows.*

---

#### 4. Confirm corrected values after update:

```sql
SELECT doc_presc_id, doc_presc_intake, doc_presc_patient_id
FROM doc_presc
WHERE doc_presc_id IN (47177, 58005, 47012);
```

| doc\_presc\_id | doc\_presc\_intake | doc\_presc\_patient\_id |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 47012          | 1/2 tsp            | 18838                   |
| 47177          | 1/2 tab            | 18060                   |
| 58005          | 1/2 Tab            | 9340                    |

---

### Summary of Fix:

* Backed up affected rows before update.
* Replaced `CHR(2)` (`\x02`) with `/` in `doc_presc_intake`.
* Validated data to ensure CCDA interface compliance.
* Confirmed `doc_presc_intake` values now use proper fractions like `1/2`.

# üìÑ README: Medication Intake Field Correction ‚Äì `doc_presc`

**Date of Fix:** July 23, 2025
**Reported by:** Gobala Krishnan B 
**Environment:** Production
**Related Tables:** `doc_presc`

---

## ‚úÖ Description

This correction addresses a data entry issue where a non-printable ASCII character (`CHR(2)` or `\x02`) appeared in the `doc_presc_intake` field, due to users typing `1\2` instead of `1/2`.

This malformed character caused:

* **CCDA interface validation failures**
* **User interface rendering issues**
* **Incorrect dosage interpretation in downstream systems**

---

## üîé Root Cause

* Users entered backslash (`\`) in medication intake like `1\2 tab`
* The backslash was interpreted as a control character (`CHR(2)`), resulting in invalid values stored as `1\x02tab`, `1\x02Tab`, `1\x02tsp`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Action Taken

### 1. Backed Up Affected Records

```sql
\copy (
  SELECT * 
  FROM doc_presc 
  WHERE doc_presc_id IN (47177, 58005, 47012)
) TO 'doc_presc_maureen_bkp_july_23_2025.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
```

### 2. Performed Targeted Data Updates

```sql
UPDATE doc_presc SET doc_presc_intake = '1/2 tab' WHERE doc_presc_id = 47177;
UPDATE doc_presc SET doc_presc_intake = '1/2 Tab' WHERE doc_presc_id = 58005;
UPDATE doc_presc SET doc_presc_intake = '1/2 tsp' WHERE doc_presc_id = 47012;
```

---

## üß™ Post-Fix Validation

* Confirmed values render correctly in UI
* CCDA interface tests passed
* No side effects observed on related workflows

---

## üìÅ Backup Details

* **Backup File:** `doc_presc_maureen_bkp_july_23_2025.csv`
* **Location:** \[Insert storage path if applicable]
* **Record Count:** 3
* **Prescription IDs:** 47177, 58005, 47012
