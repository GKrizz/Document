## What is MIPS?

**MIPS** stands for **Merit-based Incentive Payment System**. It’s part of a bigger program called the **Quality Payment Program (QPP)** run by the **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)** in the U.S. The goal of MIPS is to encourage healthcare professionals to provide the best possible care to Medicare patients by rewarding quality and efficiency.

---

### 1. Purpose

MIPS is designed to **promote value-based care**. Instead of paying doctors just for how many patients they see or procedures they do, MIPS rewards healthcare providers who give **high-quality care** while managing costs effectively.
It replaced some older systems like:

* Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS)
* Value-Based Payment Modifier (VM)
* Medicare Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program

---

### 2. Eligibility

Not every healthcare worker is part of MIPS — it applies to specific professionals such as:

* Physicians
* Physician Assistants
* Nurse Practitioners
* Clinical Nurse Specialists
* Certain eligible groups who meet CMS criteria

These clinicians are judged (or scored) based on how well they perform in certain categories.

---

### 3. Performance Categories

Clinicians’ work is evaluated in **four categories**, and each category has a certain weight in the final score:

* **Quality** (used to be called PQRS): Measures how good the care is, using specific standards related to the doctor’s specialty.
* **Promoting Interoperability** (used to be called Meaningful Use): Looks at how well the clinician uses certified electronic health records (EHRs) and shares health information.
* **Improvement Activities:** Checks if the clinician is doing things that improve patient care, like coordinating with other providers or increasing patient engagement.
* **Cost** (formerly Value-Based Payment Modifier): Looks at how much the care costs, including how much Medicare spends per patient.

---

### 4. Scoring and Payment Adjustment

Each clinician gets a **final score between 0 and 100** based on their performance in the categories above. This score impacts how Medicare pays them:

* High scores = **positive payment adjustments** (more money)
* Average scores = **neutral adjustment** (no change)
* Low scores = **negative adjustment** (penalties, less money)

---

### 5. Reporting and Compliance

Clinicians must **report data about their performance every year**. They can submit data using:

* Claims (billing information)
* Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems
* Qualified Clinical Data Registries (QCDRs)
* CMS web portals

If they don’t report or participate, they may be penalized financially.

---

### 6. Quality Improvement

A main goal of MIPS is to help healthcare providers keep getting better. Doctors receive **feedback reports** showing how they did, so they can see where to improve and make changes to provide better patient care and satisfaction.

---


## 🎯 Purpose of MIPS (Merit-based Incentive Payment System)

# ✅ **MIPS Overview & Validation Guide**

---

## 🩺 **What is MIPS?**

The **Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS)** is part of the **Quality Payment Program (QPP)** initiated by CMS to transition Medicare Part B providers from volume-based to **value-based** reimbursement.

---

## 📊 **Purpose of MIPS**

MIPS determines **Medicare payment adjustments** based on a provider's **composite performance score**. Providers can receive:

* A **positive payment adjustment (bonus)**
* A **negative adjustment (penalty)**
* Or **no adjustment**

---

## 🔁 **MIPS Replaces These Legacy Programs**

MIPS consolidates three older programs into one:

| Legacy Program                                  | Replaced By                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS)       | Quality Category                    |
| Value-Based Payment Modifier (VM)               | Cost Category                       |
| Medicare EHR Incentive Program (Meaningful Use) | Promoting Interoperability Category |

---

## 🧮 **How MIPS Works**

* Each provider's performance is scored across **four weighted categories**.
* These scores are rolled up into a **MIPS Composite Performance Score** (aka **MIPS Final Score**).
* This score determines **future Medicare Part B payment adjustments**.

---

## 📦 **The Four MIPS Performance Categories**

### 1️⃣ **Quality**

* **Replaces:** PQRS
* **Focus Areas:**

  * Patient outcomes
  * Use of medical resources
  * Safety
  * Efficiency
  * Patient experience
  * Care coordination
* **Provider Task:** Report clinical quality measures to CMS.

---

### 2️⃣ **Promoting Interoperability (PI)**

* **Replaces:** Meaningful Use (EHR Incentive Program)
* **Focus Areas:**

  * Electronic Health Record (EHR) usage
  * **Interoperability**
  * Health **information exchange**

# ✅ **MIPS Validation Flow**

---

## 🧩 **Step 1: Load Patients**

### ➤ Identify Providers

* Fetch all **providers** with **configured measures** for the selected **reporting year**.

---

### ➤ Determine Mode of Patient Collection

There are **four modes** to determine which patients to validate:

| Mode       | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mode 1** | **Audit-based**: Collect patients who have **not updated MIPS status** in the audit log and have **at least one service or encounter** in the reporting year. |
| **Mode 2** | **Current Month**: Collect all patients who had **service or encounter in the current month**.                                                                |
| **Mode 3** | **Full Year**: Collect all patients who had **service or encounter in the reporting year**.                                                                   |
| **Mode 4** | **Custom Range**: Collect all patients with **service or encounter between custom `start_date` and `end_date`**.                                              |

---

## 🧬 **Step 2: Generate & Validate QDM (Quality Data Model)**

### ➤ Collect Provider & Measure Info

* Fetch **provider data** for the **reporting year**.
* Identify the **configured quality measures**.
* Fetch relevant **clinical codes**:

  * SNOMED
  * LOINC
  * CPT
  * CVX

---

### ➤ Generate QDM Request Object

* For each patient:

  * Build the **QDM object** based on **clinical categories** and **encounter data**.
  * This object contains all relevant **measure data elements**.

---

### ➤ Validate with CDS (Clinical Decision Support)

* Send QDM request to **`hub-glacecds`**.
* Receive **response with validated measure status**.

---

### ➤ Insert Validated Data

* For each patient:

  * Insert validated **quality measure results** into the `quality_measures_patient_entries` table.

---

## 📲 **Step 3: PI (Promoting Interoperability) Measure Validation**

### ➤ Check for Hardship Exception

* If **hardship is *not* claimed**, proceed with validation.

### ➤ Collect & Validate EP Data

* Fetch **EP (Eligible Professional)** measure data.
* Validate using **Spring service** logic.
* Insert validated PI data into the **same quality entries table** for each patient.

---

## 🧮 **Step 4: Final Calculation**

* For each provider:

  * Collect **quality + PI measure counts** for each patient.
  * Aggregate counts:

    * IPP
    * Denominator
    * Numerator
    * Exclusions, Exceptions, etc.

---

### ➤ Store Results

* Insert aggregated results into **`macra_measures_rate`** table.

---

## 🔄 **Overall Flow Summary**

| 10 | Screening for **High Blood Pressure** and Follow-Up                 |
| 11 | **Tobacco Use** Screening and Cessation Intervention                |
| 12 | Diabetes: **HbA1c Poor Control** (>9%)                              |

---

### 4. **Documentation**

* For **each Not Met measure**, click on the **pencil icon** or open the **MIPS Edit Screen**.
* Enter appropriate documentation (e.g., patient declined, no longer applicable, results received).
* Save changes.

---

### 5. **Revalidate with GlaceCDS**

* Once documentation is updated, the patient’s data is **sent back to GlaceCDS** via the `/validateECQM` endpoint.
* This checks whether the documentation **fulfills the measure logic** (e.g., meets numerator, exception, or exclusion criteria).

---

### 6. **Status Update**

* If documentation is valid:

  * The measure status is **updated** from **"Not Met" → "Met" or "Excluded"**.
* The **macra\_measure\_rate** table gets updated after calculation in the next MIPS job run.

# 📘 **MIPS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

---

### **1. Why is the Flu (Influenza) Measure Not Working Properly?**

**Answer:**
The **Flu vaccination** must be **administered during the defined flu season**, which is:

> **August 1, 2017 – March 31, 2018**

Vaccinations outside this date range will **not** be counted toward the measure.

---

### **2. Why is the Medication Reconciliation Measure Count Low Even Though Doctors Perform It?**

**Answer:**
This measure is dependent on **Transition of Care (TOC)** encounters.

* **Denominator:** Number of encounters where **TOC is marked**
* **Numerator:** Number of those encounters where **medication reconciliation was documented**

🔹 To get credit: The provider **must mark the visit as a TOC encounter** first, then document **Medication Reconciliation**.

---

### **3. Why is Criteria 2 Count in the Tobacco Use Measure Low?**

**Answer:**
The **Tobacco Use: Screening and Cessation Intervention** measure includes **3 criteria**:

| Criteria | Description                                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Smoking status documented for all patients (numerator for documentation)        |
| 2        | **Tobacco users** who received **counseling** (numerator for intervention)      |
| 3        | Consolidated: Non-smokers + smokers who received counseling = overall numerator |

🔹 Low **Criteria 2** count means: Counseling was **not documented** for **patients identified as tobacco users**.

---

### **4. Why is the HIE (Health Information Exchange) Count Very Low?**

**Answer:**
The **HIE measure** requires **Direct messages** to be sent for each **Transition of Care (TOC)** or **Referral**.

* Only those encounters where a **Direct message was successfully sent** will count.
* No message = No numerator count

✅ Ensure that TOC/Referral messages are being **sent via Direct Exchange**.

---

### **5. Why is the Depression Screening Measure Not Increasing, Even Though PHQ9 is Documented?**

**Answer:**
The measure requires **specific documentation**, not just the PHQ9 form.

To satisfy the measure:

* Document **Adolescent/Adult Depression Screening** under the **HPI tab**
* For **positive results**, document related **interventions** under the **Plan tab**

❌ **PHQ9 alone does NOT qualify** for the Depression Screening MIPS measure.

📘 Refer to Glace-provided documentation for detailed steps.

---

### **6. Why Is the Hypertension (HTN): Improvement in Blood Pressure Measure Marked as Not Met?**

**Answer:**
This measure tracks **improvement over time** for patients with **initial abnormal BP** readings.

**To be marked as Met:**

1. Patient must have an **abnormal BP** documented in an encounter
2. There must be a **follow-up encounter at least 6 months later**
3. In that follow-up, BP must be **within normal range**

🔁 Without this 6-month follow-up with normal BP, the measure remains **Not Met**.
