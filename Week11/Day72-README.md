# üßæ **Case Summary**

* **Client**: Advanced Allergy & Asthma Care, LLC (Acct 039323)
* **Module**: **Chart > Faxing**
* **Issue**: When faxing **lab reports**, the **Referring Doctor info is not auto-populating**. It was working previously.
* **Assigned to**: Gobala Krishnan
* **Priority**: Medium | **Bug**
* **ETA**: 2 hours (by **7/30/2025**)

---


### üß™ Reproduction Steps

1. Navigate to a patient chart with lab orders.
2. Attempt to fax labs using the **Fax Icon** from the labs screen.
3. Observe the **"Referring Doctor" field**:
   It is **blank**, requiring manual selection via picker (which was not the case earlier).

---

### üîç Root Cause

The referring doctor info was **not being passed** as part of the URL parameters to the faxing module (`FaxLeafInformation.Action`).
Specifically, `refdocName` and `reffaxNo` were either **blank** or had placeholder values like `-1`.

---

### ‚úÖ Resolution

The fix involved **modifying the URL generation logic** to ensure all relevant referring doctor fields are properly passed to the `FaxLeafInformation.Action` request.

#### ‚úÖ Code Fix Summary

```java
// Fixed: Appending all necessary params to request for faxing
request.setAttribute("pageHeader", 
  "FaxLeafInformation.Action?xForm=" + fileName + "&" + header +
  "&faxId=" + faxId +
  "&reffaxNo=" + reffaxNo +
  "&refdocName=" + refdocName +
  "&pharmid=" + pharmid +
  "&faxNo=" + faxNo +
  "&isAttachment=" + isAttachment +
  "&attachment=" + attachment +
  "&patientId=" + patientId +
  "&patientFileAttach=" + patientFileAttach +
  "&ids=" + ids +
  "&isPresc=" + isPresc +
  "&scanCategory=" + scanCategory +
  "&CCGroupIds=" + CCGroupIds +
  "&toList=" + URLEncoder.encode(toList, "UTF-8") +
  "&fromPlan=" + fromPlan +
  "&faxMode=" + faxNewMode
);
```

#### üîß Helper Method Used

```java
private String encode(String input) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
    return URLEncoder.encode(HUtil.Nz(input, ""), "UTF-8");
}
```

---

### üß™ Post-Fix Behavior (Tested)

* Referring doctor‚Äôs **name** and **fax number** now **auto-populate** on the fax screen.
* Manual picker is no longer required unless overridden.

---

### üîÅ Regression Tested On:

* Faxing from **Labs and Tests**
* Faxing from **SOAP/Progress Notes**
* Different scenarios (with and without referring doctor present)
