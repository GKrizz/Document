Thanks ‚Äî now you‚Äôve provided the **CQL-like logic (from the spec)** for:

* ‚úÖ `Is Age 66 or Older with Advanced Illness and Frailty`
* ‚úÖ `Has Criteria Indicating Frailty`
* ‚úÖ `Has Advanced Illness in Year Before or During Measurement Period`
* ‚úÖ `Has Dementia Medications in Year Before or During Measurement Period`
* ‚úÖ `Is Age 66 or Older Living Long Term in a Nursing Home`

You‚Äôre asking to **verify whether your existing Drools rules cover these conditions correctly**.

---

## ‚úÖ Let's Validate Each Spec Against Your Rules

---

### 1. ‚úÖ **AIFrailLTCF.Is Age 66 or Older with Advanced Illness and Frailty**

**Spec Logic:**

```cql
(Age >= 66)
AND Has Criteria Indicating Frailty
AND (
   Has Advanced Illness in Year Before or During MP
   OR Has Dementia Medications in Year Before or During MP
)
```

**Your Rules:**

* Rule 12: Checks age ‚â• 66
* Rule 12: Requires **2 encounters with advanced illness dx**
* Rule 14: Checks for **dementia medication**
* Rules 15‚Äì19: Frailty checks (device, encounter, dx, assessment, symptom)

‚úÖ **Verdict:** **Yes**, your rules collectively meet this logic:

* Age check present
* Advanced illness covered via encounter-based rules
* Dementia meds checked
* Frailty handled separately (in RuleState==2 section)

üìå **Minor Suggestion:** The logic implies that **either** Advanced Illness or Dementia Meds is enough when frailty exists. Your Rule 12 demands **two separate advanced illness encounters**, which may be stricter. If CQL implies just **1 advanced illness diagnosis**, consider relaxing your logic.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ **AIFrailLTCF.Has Criteria Indicating Frailty**

**Spec Logic:**

* Any of:

  * Device Order (frailty) during measurement period
  * Assessment result = "Frailty Device"
  * Frailty diagnosis
  * Frailty encounter
  * Frailty symptom

**Your Rules:**

* Rule 15 ‚Üí Device Order
* Rule 16 ‚Üí Assessment result = Frailty Device
* Rule 17 ‚Üí Frailty Diagnosis
* Rule 18 ‚Üí Frailty Encounter
* Rule 19 ‚Üí Frailty Symptom

‚úÖ **Verdict:** Fully covered

---

### 3. ‚úÖ **AIFrailLTCF.Has Advanced Illness in Year Before or During Measurement Period**

**Spec Logic:**

* Any **diagnosis** in advanced illness value set
* Dx must start within MP or 1 year before

**Your Rule 12:**

* Uses **encounters with advanced illness diagnosis**
* Filters encounter start date within 24 months (2 years), which is actually **more lenient**

üìå **Verdict:** **Covered**, but *your window is wider* (2 years instead of 1 year). You may want to adjust `getIntervalByMonths(...) <= 12` to strictly match the spec.

---

### 4. ‚úÖ **AIFrailLTCF.Has Dementia Medications in Year Before or During Measurement Period**

**Spec Logic:**

* Active dementia meds
* Start/End overlaps with \[MP start - 1 year, MP end]

**Your Rule 14:**

```java
eval(IntervalUtilities.isOverlapping(medication.getStartDate(), medication.getEndDate(), DateUtils.addDays(request.getMeasurementPeriodStart(), -365), request.getMeasurementPeriodEnd()))
```

‚úÖ **Verdict:** Logic is correct and matches CQL perfectly

---

### 5. ‚úÖ **AIFrailLTCF.Is Age 66 or Older Living Long Term in a Nursing Home**

**Spec Logic:**

* Age ‚â• 66
* Most recent housing assessment before MP end
* Result = "Lives in nursing home (finding)"

**Your Rule 20:**

* Checks age ‚â• 66
* `Assessment` with housing status code `2.16.840.1.113883.3.225.2001.144`
* Result matches `2.16.840.1.113883.3.464.1003.113.12.1075` (which is correct)
* Ends before or on MP end

‚úÖ **Verdict:** Your implementation **matches** the CQL logic.

---

## ‚úÖ Overall Conclusion

Your current Drools rules **match the intent and detail** of the **AIFrailLTCF.* conditions*\* in the updated CQL spec **very well**. ‚úÖ

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Notes / Minor Suggestions

1. **Advanced Illness Time Window**

   * You currently allow **2 years**, but spec says **1 year** before or during MP.
   * üõ† Consider tightening to `<=12 months` to match.

2. **Relax encounter count for Advanced Illness**

   * Your Rule 12 seems to require **2 advanced illness diagnoses via encounters** (encounter1 and encounter2).
   * CQL suggests **only one** is needed (per person), so your logic might be **too strict**.

3. **Use `last()` logic for Nursing Home assessment**

   * Rule 20 doesn‚Äôt implement explicit ‚Äúlast‚Äù housing assessment.
   * If you want to mirror CQL, you could sort assessments by date and pick the most recent.

Thanks ‚Äî this is a comprehensive comparison request. You‚Äôre asking:

> **Do the existing Drools rules (v12) for `CMS125` denominator exclusions match the updated CQL-based spec (v13+)?**
> You're particularly focusing on:

* `AIFrailLTCF.Is Age 66 or Older with Advanced Illness and Frailty`
* `AIFrailLTCF.Is Age 66 or Older Living Long Term in a Nursing Home`

### üìå Let‚Äôs break this down in detail:

---

## üß† 1. `AIFrailLTCF.Is Age 66 or Older with Advanced Illness and Frailty`

### ‚úÖ CQL Spec Summary:

```
Age ‚â• 66
AND Has Criteria Indicating Frailty
AND (
   Has Advanced Illness Dx in Year Before or During MP
   OR Has Dementia Medication in Year Before or During MP
)
```

### ‚ùå Issues in Current Rule Set:

You **do not** have a **single rule** that evaluates **all 3 conditions together**:

* Age ‚â• 66
* Frailty (Rule 15‚Äì19 only fire **after** RuleState == 2)
* Dementia (Rule 14)
* Advanced illness (Rules 12, 13)

### ‚ùå Logical Disconnect

* Your Rule 12 sets `RuleState == 2` **only if two advanced illness encounters exist**
  üëâ But CQL only needs **1 diagnosis**
* Frailty rules (15‚Äì19) only run **after** RuleState is 2
  üëâ This means if a patient only has dementia (not 2 encounters), frailty logic **never runs**
* Dementia (Rule 14) sets RuleState 2, but again, no frailty check runs unless RuleState == 2

### ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Missing?

‚úîÔ∏è A wrapper rule that says:

> If Age ‚â• 66
> AND (advanced illness dx **OR** dementia meds)
> AND frailty condition (from any of 15‚Äì19)

üî• You need to **combine all three into a composite rule** for exclusion to match spec.

---

## ‚úÖ Suggested Fix

Add a new rule like:

```java
rule "Denominator Exclusion - Age 66+ with Advanced Illness and Frailty"
	when
		request:Request($patient:patient)
		response:Response($measureStatus:measureStatus.get("112"))
		Prerequisite($measureList:measureList)
		measure:EMeasure(...) from $measureList
		eval($measureStatus.getDenominator()==1 && $measureStatus.getDenominatorExclusion()==0)

		// Age ‚â• 66
		eval(IntervalUtilities.getIntervalByYears($patient.getDob(),request.getMeasurementPeriodEnd())>=66)

		// Dementia meds OR advanced illness diagnosis
		(
			// Dementia
			medication:ActiveMedication() from $patient.getActiveMedicationsList()
			eval(QDMUtilities.checkCodeAvailablity(measure,QDMCategory.MEDICATION,"2.16.840.1.113883.3.464.1003.196.12.1510",medication.getCode(),medication.getCodeSystemOID()))
			eval(IntervalUtilities.isOverlapping(medication.getStartDate(), medication.getEndDate(), DateUtils.addDays(request.getMeasurementPeriodStart(), -365), request.getMeasurementPeriodEnd()))
		)
		or
		(
			// Advanced Illness Diagnosis
			diagnosis:Diagnosis() from $patient.getDxList()
			eval(QDMUtilities.checkCodeAvailablity(measure,QDMCategory.ATTRIBUTE,"2.16.840.1.113883.3.464.1003.110.12.1082", diagnosis.getCode(), diagnosis.getCodeSystemOID()))
			eval(IntervalUtilities.getIntervalByMonths(diagnosis.getStartDate(), request.getMeasurementPeriodEnd()) <= 12)
		)

		// Frailty condition - reuse any of rules 15‚Äì19 or simplify check here
		exists(SomeFrailtyFact)
	then
		$measureStatus.setDenominatorExclusion(1);
		modify(response) {getMeasureStatus().put("112",$measureStatus)}
end
```

You can consolidate frailty logic with a helper method or keep rules 15‚Äì19 but ensure they're evaluated **within** this conditional path.

## üß† 2. `Is Age 66 or Older Living Long Term in a Nursing Home`

### ‚úÖ Spec Logic:

```cql
Age ‚â• 66
AND Last HousingStatus assessment (ending on or before MP end)
    ‚Üí result ~ "Lives in nursing home (finding)"
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues in Current Rule 20:

```java
eval(QDMUtilities.checkCodeAvailablity(measure,QDMCategory.ASSESSMENT,"2.16.840.1.113883.3.225.2001.144",...))
eval(QDMUtilities.checkCodeAvailablity(measure,"Symptom", "2.16.840.1.113883.3.464.1003.113.12.1075",...))
```

* ‚úÖ Correct housing status code
* ‚ùå But: you're not using `last()` logic ‚Äî you're matching **any** assessment with that code
* ‚ùå Also: you're checking the result code using `"Symptom"` QDM category ‚Äì likely incorrect

### ‚úÖ Fixes Needed:

1. **Get the most recent assessment (last one)** ending ‚â§ MP end
2. Match result to `"Lives in nursing home (finding)"` concept (`2.16.840.1.113883.3.464.1003.113.12.1075`) using correct QDM type (likely `QDMCategory.FINDING`)

---

### ‚úÖ Suggested Fix (Pseudocode):

```java
List<Assessment> housingAssessments = patient.getRiskAssessmentList().stream()
	.filter(assessment -> 
		QDMUtilities.checkCodeAvailablity(measure, QDMCategory.ASSESSMENT, "2.16.840.1.113883.3.225.2001.144", ...) &&
		assessment.getEndDate() != null &&
		!assessment.getEndDate().after(request.getMeasurementPeriodEnd())
	)
	.sorted(Comparator.comparing(Assessment::getEndDate).reversed()) // latest first
	.collect(Collectors.toList());

if (!housingAssessments.isEmpty() && 
	QDMUtilities.checkCodeAvailablity(measure, QDMCategory.FINDING, "2.16.840.1.113883.3.464.1003.113.12.1075", housingAssessments.get(0).getResultCode(), ...)) {
		// set exclusion
}
```

This matches the CQL semantics of **`Last()` assessment where result \~ Lives in nursing home**.
